This salary app allows the user to enter their salary and it will display a salary breakdown.

## Architecture 

The architecture this project is using is MVVM. The reason why I used MVVM is to test individual calculation functions.

## Requirements
- iOS 14.3+
- Xcode 12.5

## Features

## Dark mode
The dark mode is used to change the interface of an app to light or dark. I use dark mode in my app when the user selects light or dark in the setting then the UI element will change depending on what theme has been chosen.

## Unit testing
This project includes unit testing to test the calculation of the monthly, hourly, daily and weekly salary. 

## UI Testing
I have added UI testing to check to see if the UI behaves as it should.

## Form Validation
This project includes form validation which checks to see if the text fields are empty if they contain letters and if the salary is less than Â£12,000 then it should show an alert to the user.

## Salary Form View
This form allows the user to enter in their salary, pension contributions if they want to, the tax code and select the student loan plan.

## Accordion View
The accordion view is used to hide and show the salary breakdown.

## Reusable Views
I created reusable views so that I reduced the line of code in a file and I can now use these views in multiple places. This helps me structure my code so that is more efficient. 

## What I would like to add to the app in the future:

  - Add a dropdown where you can select the number of days you worked.
  - Add a dropdown where you can select the number of hours you worked.
  - Adding your age.
  - Allow users to save a salary. 
  - Add a Settings page where you can rate the app, share the app with a friend, leave a review and add a tip like Buy me a coffee.
  - Add Charts where you choose how you want to see the data.
